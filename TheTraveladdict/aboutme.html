        <strong>Hi, I'm Gaby & welcome to The TravelAddict</strong>
        <p>About 4,5 year ago I made my first solo trip ever. Being born and raised in Amsterdam and always staying at one place (for the most part of my life), it was always a dream of mine to explore different parts of the world. But opposed to myself,
            my friends and/or familymembers weren't in the position to just pack their bags and go. The destination was Thailand and it was the most scary thing I've ever done in my entire life. I remember myself contemplating, as I sat down on my seat
            on the plane, about when the right moment would be to yell at the other passangers that the left phalange was missing, so unless we leave the plane now, we are all going to crash and burn. Unfortunately, by the time I figured that one out
            the altitude of the plane was already rising, so there was no turning back. Definitely for the best, as I had a great time & made 2 more solo trips after my first. I'm now in a long-term relationship with somebody who loves traveling as well,
            so my solo-trip days are counted, but we always make sure we have a trip planned to look forward to.
